Woman answers the phone at the massage parlor. (Chandler looks at her.) Thank you Monica. (To the other woman) You are so sweet. (To Chandler) That was incredible! Listen, I was thinking.... (Goes to make the woman come back.)
Monica: (on phone) Hi, Kathy. (Listens) Oh no, sorry. (Listens) Yeah, I mean, this is one step closer to Phoebe and I-am-disgusted. (Listens) Okay. (Hangs up.) (To Kathy) Okay, bye. (Hangs up.) (To Monica) What did I just say?
Monica: I...
Rachel: What?! What?! Why?!
Phoebe: (To Kathy) Sure, we'll talk later.
Kathy: Okay, bye. (Hangs up.) (To Monica) What did I just say?
Monica: I...
Phoebe: I...
Monica: (To Kathy) She...
Phoebe: (Thinking) She...
Monica: (Defending) She...
Phoebe: (Defending) She did say she didn't like the way I looked and didn't want to get me.
Monica: (Defending) She didn't want to talk to me.
Phoebe: No, she wanted me to talk to her.
Monica: (Defending) She didn't want me to talk to her.
Phoebe: You didn't want...
Monica: (Defending) She didn't want me to talk to her.
Phoebe: You didn't want me to talk to her...
Monica: You didn't want me to talk to her.
Phoebe: I...
Monica: (Defending) She didn't want me to talk to her.
Phoebe: You didn't want...
Monica: You didn't want me to talk to her.
Phoebe: You didn't want me to talk to her.
Phoebe: You didn't want me to talk to her.
Monica: You didn't want...
Phoebe: You didn't want...
Monica: You didn't want...
Phoebe: You didn't want...
Monica: You didn't want...
Phoebe: You didn't want...
Monica: You don't...
Phoebe: (To Kathy) Don't tell me you didn't like the way I looked. I wanted the most, so I'd better stop looking.
Chandler: So you didn't like how I looked.
Chandler: Come on, it's a contest.
Kathy: What was I thinking?
Chandler: I wasn't thinking.
Kathy: You're not supposed to say, "You look terrific" now.
Chandler: But, I was thinking that you smell terrific. You search for that thing in your refrigerator, and by the time you get it, you've dumped it.
Kathy: You're Fired! That's a great story. I was looking forward to this. (To Kathy) It's ironic, because you'd better get used to that by then.
Kathy: You're Fired. That's a pretty funny story, that actually made you think a little bit. (We see Kathy searching for the pear.) Oh, I'm gonna go find that thing.
Chandler: You know what I'm worried about?
Kathy: Hmm, Susan and I just had a nuget about what we'd do today.
Chandler: Oh, I got it.
Kathy: Uhm, you know, you guys may have feelings for each other, but uhm, Susan wants to be with you right now.
Chandler: So, we're gonna have a nuget?
Kathy: Yeah.
Chandler: You know, I mean, it's probably not what you think.
Kathy: It is.
Chandler: You know what, I mean, given what we do?
Kathy: Yeah, what else?
Chandler: I don't know what else.
Kathy: I don't know what else.
Chandler: All right, maybe, y'know what, we're gonna have a great time. (A woman walks by.)
Woman: Thank you for shopping with us, Mr. Bing.
Mr. Bing: Oh, hi, this is Kathy. Kathy, this is Mr. Bing, this is Kathy, this is Kathy, and this is Mr. Bing.
Fat Girl: Hi, Kathy.
Kathy:
