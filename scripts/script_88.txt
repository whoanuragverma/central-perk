Rachel: Nooo, I mean, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, it's just it felt really weird, I was planning on putting Emma on Emma's date.
Phoebe: Oh, I'm sorry, it was a date.
Rachel: Yeah, it felt like a date. 
Phoebe: (To Monica) Should we tell her?
Monica: (To Rachel) Oh, just tell her. 
Phoebe: No, don't do that! 
Monica: (To Rachel) No, don't do that! 
Phoebe:  (To Monica) What? 
Monica: (Thinking Monica is going to say something) Oh my God, why did you do this? 
Phoebe: (Hums while saying this) It was Emma's date. 
Phoebe: (Storms out after her) Ross, it was her date! 
Ross: She was my date.
Rachel: You know, it's so hard for you to date another woman, let alone this drunk, seventeen-year old, who has just broken up with me. 
Ross: You know, I know it might sound crazy and a little crazy, but honey, you're not supposed to date another woman just for the sake of it. 
Rachel: Oh, I know too, but you have to remember, this is your apartment. Okay, all right, so that's how it's supposed to be, ok? And I'm supposed to be, you know, drunk, seventeen-year old, and all I hear is, "Oh my God, she's so hot in here!" 
Ross: I just don't think that's what this is. 
Rachel: Oh, I'm sorry, Ross. 
Ross: I'm sorry, Rachel, but... I have this really strong feeling, it's about to happen. 
Rachel: You're on me. 
Ross: I have strong feeling, it's about to happen. 
Rachel: You have no right to tell another woman that she is hot. 
Ross: No, I'm telling you I have no such thing, and I don't even have any such thing. 
Rachel: Oh, Ross, you're right. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. 
Ross: Sorry! 
Rachel: Let her go.

Ross: She also has a date with a guy. (They all look at each other and then back up at her, still very excited) 
Rachel: You got a really great kiss. 
Ross: Really? 
Rachel: Yeah. 
Ross: (in a sexy voice) Guess we'll call ya later. (They all go and close the door) 
Rachel: Ahh, so, do you know how to kiss a guy? 
Ross: (in a sexy voice) Whoa, whoa, whoa.
