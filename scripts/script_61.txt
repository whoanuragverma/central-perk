Joey: Awww, stop! This is terrible! Ross, what are you doing?
Ross: I wanted it to be nice. Wait a minute, I'm the boss, I'm not the boss.
Joey: What?
Ross: I'm the boss.
Joey: What?
Ross: Oh... Joey... I'm-I'm selling you out. You've got the apartment.
Joey: What?
Ross: I'm not getting out of this. This is what I wanna see and I'm not gonna let you take away from it. (Joey and Ross look very shocked) Alright, fine. I don't think we're gonna let you do this, alright? This is what I'm gonna do to you. You're gonna be moving in with Ross and I think this is gonna make things a lot easier.
Joey: Hey, umm, okay, I know you're not all that happy about this, but...
Ross: I know. I know. I know. I just-I just have to know that you're okay with this. I mean, you know, it's the last time we're together and this is the last time you're a roommate.
Joey: Oh my-oh, Ross, you gotta take it. This is the last holiday we've been together and this is the last time you're a roommate.
Ross: No! You can't, hey! You can't, hey!! (pause) But you can't, hey!
Joey: Ross...
Ross: No, hey! Don't try to take it, it's not gonna work.
Joey: But...
Ross: Look, maybe you have to try! Maybe you can't do this, but...
Joey: But...
Ross: But...
Joey: But...
Ross: But...
Joey: But...
Ross: But...
Joey: But...
Ross: But...
Joey: But...
Ross: But...
Joey: But...
Ross: But...
Joey: But...
Monica: Oh my god, this is the casserole place! These are the best casseroles in the world.
Rachel: You know what? I'm gonna go into that kitchen. The last one's closed.
Joey: So what?
Ross: I got my wish. (to Monica) Please, just let me cook, okay? When I'm not feeling so weird about actually being with you, I just want to have someone else to... (whispering) 
Phoebe: (entering, carrying a tray with cereal) Hey! (to Monica) Hey!
Monica: Hey!
Phoebe: Hey, listen. It's really nice to be back here, aren't ya?
Monica: Yeah, it is, but you're... the oldest woman in the restaurant.
Phoebe: (sniffing) Older than me.
Monica: Honey, it's not that old. It's older than me.
Phoebe: You know, it was me when I had a girlfriend.
Monica: Phoebe, why?
Phoebe: Because, you know, I had a girlfriend. And you didn't.
Monica: Phoebe, you had a girlfriend when I had a boyfriend.
Phoebe: No, not anymore. You got my girlfriend.
Monica: Why? Why can't we have a girlfriend when it was just between me and Ross?
Phoebe: Well, no, I have some stuff going on between us.
Monica: You know, it's weird. I find it really unsettling when people think I have a girlfriend.
Phoebe: You know, when I had a girlfriend, it was just because I was with someone, y'know? It was just because it felt like I was.
Monica: Phoebe, you're not still with someone.
Phoebe: You know what? I think I'm just beginning to like you a little bit.
Monica: (overhearing that) Because you were with Ross.
Phoebe: Oh my god, honey, are you okay?
Monica: (overhearing that) I think I'm okay. (Phoebe looks her over)
Phoebe: What?
Monica: That's all right, we're not having a boyfriend.
Phoebe: No, we're not having a boyfriend!
Monica: What?
Phoebe: You're right, we're not! We're just having a boyfriend!
Monica: No, we're not! 
Phoebe:
