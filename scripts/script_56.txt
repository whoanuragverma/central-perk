Monica: I'm not going to be able to make it!
Chandler: Y'know I think he's doing this all on his own.
Monica: Yeah, I'm sorry. I think I'm just gonna take a nap.
Chandler: Yeah. (in a sexy voice) You're doing great.
Monica: Oh thank you so much. (they kiss)
Joey: Hey!
Chandler: Hey!
Joey: Yeah!
Monica: Do you think this is funny?
Chandler: Yeah! Hey, I'm not an actor, and I still have no idea what "faking it to be an audition" is.
Joey: Whoa-whoa-whoa, yeah, it's pretty much all you can drink in a day! (he goes into the kitchen)

Rachel: Oh my God, is that even a thing?
Ross: I don't know, it's incredible! I mean, the chemistry, the personalities, you know, I mean, you're trying to find something that makes you who you are? I mean, who are you? Who are you?
Rachel: Who are you?
Ross: I don't know.
Rachel: You wanted me to be who I am?
Ross: All right, then you have to accept that, because you're not who you are, and that doesn't change the fact that I am you.
Rachel: You don't understand!
Ross: Yes, but you should understand because understanding means agreeing to do some stuff for me. So if you understand a little something, I'm gonna understand a little things.
Rachel: You just have to accept that.
Ross: Just agree. Otherwise, you're just gonna wreck the whole
