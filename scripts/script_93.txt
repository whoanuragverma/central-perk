Monica: You can't put her back in that place.
Joey: What?
Monica: I think it's better that way.
Joey: All right, fine! Fine! Don't talk to me. I'll just have her sent to the mental hospital.
Chandler: And sorry, waiter, sorry.
Monica: What's she saying?
Chandler: She's saying that you don't serve food with food that's in your mouth.
Monica: (in a mocking voice) "Weren't we both late for our reservations?"
Chandler: I may have asked, you never have to ask.
Monica: Are you mocking her?
Chandler: Oh, it's okay. I'm not mocking her!
Monica: Oh, she's just watching me eat her dinner! I am mocking my food!
Chandler: She's not watching you?
Monica: Well you certainly aren't watching me!
Chandler: What are you mocking?
Monica: I'm mocking my food!
Chandler: I'm also mocking my friendliness.
Monica: Oh, she is very kind. (They kiss.)
Chandler: And by friendly, I mean people who go out of their way to help poor Monica. (She kisses him)
Monica: (to Chandler) So, how did you guys meet?
Chandler: Um, Rachel and I... uh... we went to a party in Vermont a couple of weeks ago.
Monica: What did you guys do?
Chandler: Well, we went out for two days, and then Rachel got sick and we only had food.
Monica: Oh my God, what happened in Vermont?
Chandler: Well, we went shopping and then... elsewhere...
Monica: So, what did you guys do?
Chandler: Well, Rachel and I went shopping together. And then, after we walked past them, she said something to me.
Monica: What?
Chandler: I said, "You and Rachel."
Monica: So it wasn't about her and me?
Chandler: No, I mean, you know, I mean, she was just saying "You and Rachel" (walks away)
Monica: You never said "I" to her. What were you thinking?
Chandler: Well, I mean, maybe it wasn't about me and Rachel, maybe it was about Ross and... oh my God! (blows raspberry and runs away)
Phoebe: Hi!
Ross: Hey!
Phoebe: Oh, good to see you!
Ross: Hey, I'm Ross and this is Rachel.
Rachel: Hi!
Ross: Hey, why don't you tell me about your day!
Rachel: Oh, uh, I didn't know you guys were going away was soo bad.
Ross: Yeah, I was, but I ended up going away for a couple days, so I dropped by...
Rachel: Okay, if Rachel doesn't know what Ben Does, just know that he's doing something that makes me happy.
Phoebe: Really? So sounds like you'd think you'd get it?
Chandler: Yeah, really. (he takes a bite out of a sandwich)
Monica: (notices something) Oh my God, what are we feeding?
Rachel: Phoebe, what?
Phoebe: You took some chicken breast with you!
Rachel: Phoebe, you didn't!
Phoebe: No you did!
Phoebe: No you didn't!
Phoebe: No you didn't!
Rachel: Phoebe, you did! You did!
Phoebe: No you didn't!
Rachel: You did! You did!
Phoebe: No you didn't!
Rachel: You did! You did!
Phoebe: You did! You did!
Rachel: Phoebe, you did!
Phoebe: No you didn't!
Rachel: You did! You did!
Phoebe: No you didn't!
Rachel: You did! You didn't!
Phoebe: No you didn't!
Rachel: You did! You did!
Phoebe: No you didn't!
Rachel: You didn't!
Phoebe: No you didn't!
Rachel: You didn't!
Phoebe: No you didn't!
Rachel: You didn't!
Phoebe: No you didn't!
Ross: So what does Ben do?
Monica: He helps
