Rachel: Oh, I know. I know. I know. How about this...this...
Joey: (entering, holding a box) Hey!
Rachel: Joey, where are you going?
Joey: To the bathroom.
Rachel: How did you know?
Joey: I know because I went in there looking for 'em.
Rachel: Okay.
Joey: (to the bathroom) Hey! Can I borrow your vacuum? (She doesn't have one.)
Rachel: What?
Joey: I don't have a vacuum!
Rachel: You do, you do, but I'm not gonna use it.
Joey: What?
Rachel: Joey's using my vacuum!
Joey: Why? What's wrong?
Rachel: What...
Joey: I'm having a shower, alright?
Rachel: What's up?
Joey: I have a science fair...
Rachel: A science fair, actually.
Joey: Yeah, so I get to see all the stuff.
Rachel: You get to see all the stuff. 
Joey: Yeah, I got you a new broom closet and a new sink. And-and...and I even got a copy of the adoption rule book.
Rachel: Oh.
Joey: And-and I even got an interview with Erica Warshaw.
Rachel: Interviewer? Who?
Joey: Erica Warshaw? I mean that would've been... awful!
Rachel: Ok, ok, ok. Well, listen, listen. I'm sorry, but I just got so many questions, I'm gonna let you guys do it and... well, I have a lot of questions!
Gary: Hey, what's up?
Rachel: Hey, Gary.
Gary: Hey...
Rachel: Ok, great! So I'm on hold for this, but you know, I gotta get to Dakota, OK? (Gary looks at her) So, uh, what's the name of Dakota?
Gary: Uhh, uh...uh...
Rachel: Uhh, uh...
Gary: Okay, well, I really wanna see what the reaction will be. I want to see what people think of this show.
Rachel: Oh, you wanna see what people think of this show?
Gary: I don't wanna see what people think of me.
Rachel: You wanna see what people think of you?
Gary: What, you wanna know the reaction to my show?
Rachel: Oh! I know! I know! I know! I know! I mean, it's amazing! I mean, I can't even imagine what the reaction would be, you know? But I gotta see it, it's amazing! I mean, I can't stop loving you. I love you so much. Oh, I know I gotta see you do stuff, but I gotta get to work! I gotta get to work, it's just gotta be me.
Gary: Hey, Rach, do you wanna get a job?
Rachel: Oh! I am so glad you asked!
Gary: Uh, I know I do too.
Rachel: Ok, so let's see, who do you like?
Gary: Uhm... Erin, Erin, Erin.
Rachel: Oh my God! You know what I love most about this show? When you're like a hundred percent at the top, and all you do is be yourself, and I can't believe it, I've never had any problem rejecting someone.
Gary: There's something different.
Rachel: Oh, you know, I always loved being like you. When people give you money to quit, it's because they don't know you're bad for their eyes.
Gary: But it is the truth, Rach, and you know it when you see it. I mean, I was so afraid of you, that I never even tried to hate you.
Rachel: That is so sweet.
Gary: And Erin, I mean, you're wearing so much more than just clothes, you know? You're human too, you're...
Rachel: (interrupts him) What?
Gary: I mean, look at me, I mean, look at me, look at me, don't you have any friends?
Rachel: Oh, you know, Joey and Erin and Joey and Erin and...
Gary: So what about us?
Rachel: No, no, no!
Gary: No, no, no, no...
Rachel: No, no, no, no...
Gary: No, no, no, no...
Rachel: No, no, no, no...
Gary: No, no, no, no, no...
Rachel: No,
