Rachel: Hey, did you guys hear anything? I wonder if they heard that Rachel and Chandler are getting back together? We weren't there yesterday!
Chandler: We certainly didn't hear that!
Rachel: Well, I guess I heard that!
Joey: I-I-I-I-I don't have a girlfriend.
Ross: But-but, listen, listen, say it ain't so bad, I wanna do it too!
Rachel: Hey, you know what? I think I'm gonna do it too.
Ross: You're running out on your life, aren't you?
Rachel: No, I'm not! I'm (pauses) Stopping to think about how I don't have a girlfriend, thinking about how I don't have a life!
Monica: I don't have a life!
Rachel: Okay, you're not gonna get one!
Ross: I know, I know...
Monica: Mmm, I had a boyfriend!
Ross: Oh, you had a boyfriend?! I mean, that's like twice as long!
Monica: (checks it again) No, no, no... (starts to think) You knew about that!
Ross: I knew!
Monica: You knew because you told me about me and how you loved me!
Ross: You knew about that because you told me about your boyfriend!
Monica: Oh my God, you knew about that!
Ross: You knew about that!
Chandler: You know, the first time I told you, you were so mad at me, you didn't care about my feelings!
Ross: No, you knew about that!
Monica: You knew about that!
Ross: You knew about that!
Monica: You knew about that!
Chandler: You know, I can't believe I did this!
Phoebe: You're not mad at us?
Monica: No, you're not mad at us either.
Ross: You're not mad at us either?
Monica: No, you're mad at us!
Ross: You're not mad at us?
Monica: No, you're mad at us!
Ross: You're not mad at us?
Monica: No, you're mad at us!
Ross: You're not mad at us?
Monica: No, you're mad at us!
Ross: You're not mad at us?
Monica: No, you're mad at us!
Ross: You're not mad at us?
Monica: No, you're mad at us!
Ross: You're not mad at us?
Monica: No, you're mad at us!
Ross: You're not mad at us?
Monica: Yes, but, I don't feel like taking it personally.
Ross: (nervous) You are?
Monica: Oh, you are... (starts to take off her coat) I'm so sorry, this is so hard!
Ross: You know what? I think I'm gonna do this. I'm gonna tell everyone about what I just told you... I'm gonna get you your job back, you are the maid of honor.
Monica: (yelling) You're so lucky!
Ross: Yeah, I got it!
Monica: You're lucky to have it back!
Ross: Yeah...
Chandler: You are the most beautiful woman I ever!!
Phoebe: You're so lucky.
Chandler: You were there. You were there. (to Rachel) And your stupid best friends keep talking about us!
Rachel: I know... I know... I mean, when I said the part last time, I didn't mean that I was losing my girlfriend. I mean, I know how much I wanna lose a friend, and my friends always want the same thing: Someone to hold my girlfriend in their arms.
Chandler: You know what? I think I can forgive them, if they do say they're not going to parties where everyone is whispering... "You're so lucky. I miss you."
Rachel: You know what? I think I can forgive them, too...
Chandler: You know what? I think I can forgive them too...
Monica: Hey, how did it go with Ross last night?
Rachel: Oh, that was really sweet.
Monica: Yeah?
Rachel: Oh, so pretty and make-up and makeup.
Monica: Oh, Rachel, we were pretty and make-up and makeup.
Rachel: So, who did you like for your lipstick?
Monica: Oh, Phoebe
