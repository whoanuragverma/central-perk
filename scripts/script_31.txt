Monica: Couldn't you have just said what you did earlier…
Joey: Which is we're gonna call her?
Monica: Monica!! (She starts to run away but she runs into a wall.) Monica, time's up! (To Chandler and Joey) Look! (She runs off.)
Ross: Hi!
Chandler: Is something wrong?
Ross: Chandler can we get you a cup of coffee?
Joey: (To Monica and Ross) I wanted to ask you something though.
Chandler: Really? What do you mean "something?"
Monica: (In a soothing tone) Relax. Think of the gift.
Ross: (In an Australian tinge) Oh, great!
Joey: (Poking his head in from his bedroom) What?
Ross: There's something you can do. I can help you relax.
Joey: Okay. Watch. (He does so.)
Ross: Relax. Think of the gift.
Joey: Okay. Watch. (He does so again, and Ross silently stretches his neck in a nonchalant manner.) Relax! Think of the gift.
Ross: Hey! I need you to be quiet for a minute.
Joey: Oh, that's okay. I'm gonna be doing a silent auction.
Chandler: I'm not doing a silent auction?
Ross: Yeah, I'm doing a movie.
Chandler: (starting to cry) You guys are gonna be so sad.
Ross: Yeah, I guess.
Rachel: Okay, now I have to tell you something. I have a secret, I have a secret with a man. A secret that I have with a woman. Okay? He's my lover. I love him. And I can't tell him, but I am gonna try. Okay? I'm gonna touch his face. (She kisses him on the cheek.)
Ross: You-you kiss me, Rachel.
Rachel: (sadly) Oh, he doesn't know.
Ross: Thanks man, I didn't know you'd be interested.
Joey: I know. (He picks up a skull of some carnivore found in Central America.)
Ross: What's a carnivore like?
Joey: It's a small, round, furry snake.
Ross: Huh? How do you spell carnivore?
Joey: Tips?
Ross: Tips don't say tips. (He stands up and we see him drinking.) So, I say Carnadine. (He starts with a sip, but stops when Joey notices him) Huh?
Joey: (with a smirk) I like it.
Ross: What?
Joey: I've missed you hard.
Ross: I've missed you hard. (They hug.)
Rachel: Joey, you kissed me first.
Joey: Okay.
Ross: What?
Joey: I thought it was going to be that way.
Rachel: Oh my God! You kissed me first!
Joey: Okay, I'm sorry you didn't tell me, but I thought we were just two twos away from each other.
Ross: Well,…
Rachel: Yeah, but it was way past midnight.
Joey: I missed you so much last night. You were the one person I wanted to kiss.
Ross: (pause) Not you.
Joey: You kissed me to get out of having sex with Daryl Hannah.
Monica: Oh my God! You kissed me to get out of having sex with Daryl Hannah!
Joey: You can have a closet and you can not be in there when the police are there.
Monica: (gets it) What?!
Joey: Whoa! Whoa-whoa, whoa, whoa! They just…they don't tell you anything. They just…
Rachel: Oh my God! You still don't know that I punched you in the stomach?
Joey: Well, you didn't punch me in the stomach, you punched you in the stomach to have sex with me.
Rachel: Well I did punch you in the stomach.
Joey: So?
Rachel: So what?
Joey: Well, I was at the game and you guys were there and I wasn't. So I'm telling you I punched you in the stomach cause you're gonna be watching football, there's not much I can do.
Ross: Oh, that's great. I'm glad you liked it.
Joey: I liked it.
Ross: You did.
Joey: Yeah, but I wasn't seeing the box because you guys chose to stay at my place. So who's to say football is
