Joey: Yeah-yeah!
Ross: Hey!
Joey: Hey!
Ross: Joey, you-you gotta be kidding me! I-I, I-I-I gotta go! (The nurse walks by, he hands Joey a pink, folded up blanket.)
Joey: What?
Ross: This is our last meal. We're not getting married. I don't care where we are!
Joey: You don't have to go!! (The nurse exits.)
Ross: Who?
Joey: The rabbi.
Ross: I don't know.
Rachel: Oh my God! (They hug.) Well, here you go. Here you go.
Ross: Thanks.
Rachel: Thank you. (The nurse exits.)
Joey: Here we go. Here we go. (The woman who brought Joey to the hospital is then seen entering.) Oh, so sweet of you! (The woman hands him a little tissue with a recipe for homemade homemade tomato sauce and Joey makes a “What?” face.)
Rachel: Hey, I made that!
Joey: Oh, I can’t believe it!
Rachel: I know! I know! I-I-I made that!
Joey: Okay, now you just have to beat your friend to death.
Rachel: Okay, then I am! (Joey nods and Rachel quickly wipes the dishes.)
Emily: (To Rachel) Okay, I’ll talk to you later.
Rachel: Okay, good for you! Okay, I’ll talk to you later.
Emily: Okay, good for you.
Rachel: Bye. (Starts to walk out.)
Joey: So…
Rachel: (To Dick) Has there ever been such a thing as the "two breasts in the same drawer?"
Joey: Yeah… fat!
Ross: So what’s Dick about?
Joey: Well, he’s a big guy and he’s fat.
Ross: Well, there’s nothing wrong with fat.
Joey: But can you give him a reason to be upset?
Ross: I have a date tomorrow, it’s at your place. He’s not gonna find me attractive. (The bell rings and he goes into his apartment.)
Joey: Oh, ok. I’m just gonna have to find a new date.
Ross: (To Rachel) I knew it. (Runs out.)
Ross: (To Emily) I’m sorry you had to go that far to make me feel that way, but I…
Emily: Oh my God! I loved this sweater.
Ross: It’s so soft and you… (He tries to pull on the pocket, but it’s too tight) which is what you were trying to pull.
Emily: (pulling) You pulled on my pocket?!
Ross: (To Rachel) Did you see the sweater?
Rachel: No, I saw the zipper!
Phoebe: (entering) Hey!
Emily: Hey, Pheebs!
Phoebe: (notices that Rachel is still glaring at him) What?
Emily: Oh my God! I guess you were right.
Rachel: I just always assumed that you were just staring at me.
Phoebe: What? I am not staring at you.
Emily: I am, I'm correcting you. I just… I always thought that I was this fat woman who had the most in common.
Rachel: What?!
Emily: Actually, Ross and I share the same uterus.
Rachel: Oh. (Sits down) Oh my God! Emily, I just stopped to think how close we got.
Emily: I know.
Rachel: Oh, I know.
Joey: (entering) Hey.
Ross: Hey! What's up?
Joey: Uhh, here’s a story. I uh, I went across the street and uh, picked this out for Rachel, and it’s the exact same as it was yesterday.
Rachel: Oh. (Pause) Oh my God! I can’t believe this! Did you give me a reason to be upset?
Joey: I didn’t want to tell you my story, I just wanted the two of you to have a little more time to develop.
Ross: Yeah, okay. Yeah, you’re right, I’m sorry. I was a little nervous, but whatever! (Starts to leave.)
Joey: Hey you guys, I’m sorry. I just uh, I just can’t see Ross
