Phoebe: (seeing a guy) Hi!
Guy: Hey.
Phoebe: How's the guy doing?
Guy: Good! As long as we keep throwing him around we'll be fine.
Phoebe: Oh no. I know, that girl is really great though.
Guy: Hey, thanks for the tip. Anyway, I think I'm just going over your message.
Phoebe: (to Joey) And that was your message?
Joey: Yeah! I think you told him what you were going to say?
Phoebe: (stopping her from saying what she just said) No, no, no! I'm not gonna lie, I knew who I told.
Joey: (deadpan) So?
Phoebe: Well, I don't think so.
Joey: (utterly shocked) Why did you do that?
Phoebe: I hate lying! Yeah, I hate lying, but if it bothers you, you don't lie!
Joey: (shocked) You did?
Phoebe: Yeah, I hate lying. (She walks away.)
Joey: (shocked) Oh-oh-oh! I told you not to lie!
Susan: Hey-hey-hey-hey!
Phoebe: What?
Joey: Hey!
Susan: Oh, I was just in the store, I overslept.
Joey: (shocked) Oh, you shouldn’t have. I overslept. (Sits down next to her.)
Susan: (shocked) I lied!
Phoebe: (seeing her) Oh my! I knew it! (She runs to her room, but Joey runs in and hides her in.)
Susan: So you did the right thing by Ross and Rachel.
Joey: Yeah. But what did I do?
Susan: You did the right thing.
Joey: I knew about you. I knew about you. I had a plan. (It’s clearly not working, but he still gets nervous.)
Susan: What did I do?
Joey: I know what I did. I know about you. (Looks at her.)
Susan: What? (Grabs her by the arm.)
Joey: Don’t try to trick me! I'm not! I'm not! I'm not! I'm not! (He drops her and starts banging on her door again.)
Susan: You gotta stop messing with me! I'm not your bitch!
Joey: So what? You're not your bitch! (Susan just glares at him.)
Susan: (running back in) What the hell are you doing?!!
Joey: You should’ve told him!! (Sneezes)
Chandler: I think if he knew he would think it was you. And if he knew he would think it was you.
Joey: Wh-wh-what is wrong with me?
Chandler: He doesn’t have a girlfriend. He doesn’t know what he’s doing. And he doesn’t care which one of us he is!
Joey: I think he’s a loser.
Chandler: You can’t date a loser!
Joey: But I’m a loser! But I’m also a loser!!
Chandler: But I’m also a loser!!
Joey: But I’m also a loser!!
Chandler: But I’m also a loser!!
Phoebe: (entering) Hey.
Monica: Hey!
Phoebe: Where are you both going?
Monica: Oh! I’m so exhausted I almost vomit! But I’m gonna go get some, y’know, before I vomit again. (She gets up, and she is joined by Phoebe and Chandler, who is about to enter the room by Monica and Phoebe.)
Phoebe: What’s going on?
Monica: Well, the baby found a new home. It’s stuck puppy outside. (Monica turns and looks at Phoebe.) I think I swallowed it all.
Ross: Hey Phoebe! How’s it feeling? Is it okay if you’re not here to visit?
Phoebe: No. I-I-I-I don’t know what to say. It’s so sweet. I think I’m gonna go see my Aunt Phoebe.
Ross: (To the guy sitting next to him
