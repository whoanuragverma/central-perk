Ross: Hey, you know what you should do, you should take a walk.
Joey: I wanna go, but I can't because I have a girlfriend!
Ross: When I told her that I was going out with Rachel, she was really supportive.
Joey: Yeah! I guess you're the first one.
Ross: Hey, y'know who else has really great shoes?
Joey: Uhh, I did! I went all over the place to get shoes, and Rachel made me wear boots that looked like they might actually hit something.
Ross: Ohh that's so sweet....
Joey: But Rachel didn't know it was coming.
Ross: She did, and she didn't know it was coming.
