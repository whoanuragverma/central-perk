Hi!

Chandler: Chandler Bing, I'm in the relationship department.
Phoebe: Oh! So! So you're gonna be a counselor?
Chandler: Ask him.
Joey: Can I get a bag of groceries?
Chandler: Yes! Yes! You can wear your hair down to your nippys!
Joey: You're taking the wrong step!
Chandler: What?
Joey: We're talking about a plan! A plan! A plan!
Chandler: Okay, listen to me. The only person I'm gonna spend time with who hasn't been this counselor before is you! I-I'm the one guy who says no more than once!
Joey: Huh.
Chandler: I know, but we're talking about you!
Joey: Me too!
Chandler: Okay, I'm so glad you decided to come.
Joey: Thanks. (hugs him) I'm gonna be OK.
Chandler: So uh, what're you gonna do with the rest of the house?
Joey: Probably stay put.
Chandler: You know what Joey? You maybe not want to move in with me, but if you have to, you should. You really, really deserve this. (Joey nods)
Phoebe: I know, I know, I know. What's up?
Phoebe: What?
Phoebe: You don't have to tell me what's going on.
Monica: What's going on?
Phoebe: Well, I just, I googled 'husband.' And it says 'Chandler.' I didn't know if that was a combination of husband and wife. I'm not sure, but yeah it kinda seems to me to indicate either of them.
Rachel: Yeah, I know.
Phoebe: You do know that in these difficult times I should not be afraid to ask, 'wife?'
Monica: Oh, you're so great.
Phoebe: Oh, you're so sweet. (Monica looks at her.) 
Monica: So what do you say?
Phoebe: Well, I said I'm sorry and I'm gonna go find him and have dinner with him.
Monica: Oh, wait, I forgot. Do you think maybe he's not still in this room because someone's been whispering? (Phoebe looks over at her.) Ooh! Are you okay?
Phoebe: Oh yeah, it's just not the same without your help. You know, I really wanna help you out here, okay? So you wanna help me out too?
Monica: Okay. Fine. I can do it.
Phoebe: So how's it going?
Monica: Good. Yay! I hope you're happy, because it's been really hard lately. (Phoebe turns and looks at her again.) 
Phoebe: Men are always telling me how to do things, Phoebe.
Monica: Well, anyway, y'know what, you should be able to do this without knocking over.
Phoebe: Yeah, I can do that, actually.
Monica: I know, you're right, I know, I know, but it just feels so right. I mean, the way you held me down all those steps ago is by-by you're-by-you're not telling me anything.
Phoebe: You're not telling me anything? I can't do anything. Just listen to the phone call.
Monica: Okay. (Goes to do so.) (Does so.) (Does so as Phoebe enters.) 
Phoebe: (entering) Hey. Oh, this is Joey Tribbiani. Hey! (Hits him and his friends.) Hey, I know you guys like to go out for a drink or something.
Monica: Yeah, but I think this beerâ€™s better spent.
Phoebe: Oh, it's on the fridge.
Chandler: God! I thought it would last a lifetime!
Chandler: Hey! (Tries to hold it in while Monica and Phoebe enter.) How you doing with that? (Hits him.)
Phoebe: Hey! (Throws it at him again.)
Monica: Hey! (Throws it back again.)
Phoebe: (Throws it at him again.)
Joey: (entering) Oh, hey guys! I wanna go to the movie with you guys! (He hurries out.)
Rachel: So, what do you think of Chandler
