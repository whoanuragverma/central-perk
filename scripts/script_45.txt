Joey: Hey! Heyyyy! How ya doin’?
Chandler: Hey! Look! Here’s a bottle of champagne you can use to cool your face.
Joey: I can’t believe I even think about doing that.
Chandler: So you’re thinking about getting a bottle of champagne?
Joey: So what?
Chandler: Six years of Grammerie, closed blind, Walt Disney Company and now I’m saying, "No more Grammerie!"
Joey: Tell me about it!
Chandler: How do you spell Walt? (Joey nods ‘W.")
Joey: Ok!
Chandler: How do you spell that to a guy?
Joey: I don’t know. It’s always ‘I’m-I’m Joey’s joke. (Phoebe enters.) Hey Pheebs!
Phoebe: Hey!
Monica: Hey! How’d the audition go?
Phoebe: Oh it went great! It was great, I’m having a great time.
Monica: Ross you’re audition taking me?
Phoebe: There’s only got to be one way to say it! (She turns to Monica and mouths ‘I’ for Ross!’.)
Monica: All right, could you give us a sec?
Phoebe: Oh my God sure, thanks.
Monica: No I don’t think so.
Phoebe: Why?
Monica: I don’t know, you’re just so great.
Phoebe: Yeah! So who would really do it?
Monica: Y’know, I would do it, you would. (Phoebe nods in agreement.) Ross, why don’t you give us a few reasons you would do it.
Ross: Well, in an ideal world…
Phoebe: I’m sorry, but y’know what? I’m not going to spend all day and night perfecting it, but I’m gonna be able to get on the phone and say, "I’m ready for audition."
Monica: Oh my…
Ross: I’m sorry, but I don’t think this is how you want to see me audition.
Phoebe: Why?
Ross: Well I’m your dad. I’m on a audition!
Phoebe: Oh my God!
Ross: See?
Monica: Yes!
Phoebe: But you’re supposed to audition for an actor, you can’t just come in and say, "Hey dad, look, I’m sorry about that stupid screen job thing." I mean, a character should be able to say, "Hey, look, I’m sorry."
Ross: Okay, let’s move on.
Monica: Ross, come on! I mean, you-you have such a great face! (Phoebe smiles bright.) Oh my God, this-this is so obvious! (Monica goes over and kisses him on the cheek.) Here we go! Good night!
Rachel: Hello!
Monica: (To Rachel) Okay, bye-bye!
Rachel: (To Monica) Okay, y’know what? You’re right. I’m gonna go. Bye! (Exits.)
Monica: (To Rachel) Okay, see? You’re the best she’s ever been!
Rachel: Ohh, no, I know that. But I just want to say that I’m really gonna go, and that thanks for being here.
Monica: Oh, I know! So where’s Chandler?
Rachel: Oh, Chandler lives in Rosedale!
Monica: Chandler lives in Rosedale!
Rachel: Yeah, and I know, Chandler is—hey! That’s why I didn’t ask you to marry me!
Monica: Look, I’m sorry, but Chandler just had his fun yesterday!
Rachel: Oh well, I’m sorry too, but he’s having a lot of fun!
Monica: He’s having his fun?!
Rachel: Well, I’m sorry I was so worried about accepting this and I’m so sorry! (Starts crying.)
Rachel: Y’know what? I think I can handle this. (They hug.)
