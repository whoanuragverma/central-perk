Monica: Ah, thank you, Phoebe.
Phoebe: Ah! Thank you. (to Monica) What happened?
Monica: Oh!
Phoebe: It was, um, I lost my job.
Monica: What?
Phoebe: I lost my job! And I lost my career! And I lose my career! I have to live on the streets. I mean, I’m an artist! I’m an actor! I just can’t do this.
Monica: Joey, you don’t seem very excited about everything.
Joey: What?! I have everything I need! I mean, I give everything I have to be happy! And you’re not happy with that $800,000! That’s all I have!
Phoebe: You’re so generous! I mean, you can have like this! Y’know I mean I’m crying all over you right now! I mean, you could be living on the streets, you know, with that money.
Joey: What?!
Phoebe: Okay, just stay here and give me this.
Monica: Okay, I’m gonna leave.
Joey: Oh, I’m so sorry. So?
Chandler: You did a great job.
Joey: What?!
Chandler: I’m sorry. I don’t know what it is, y’know what I was thinking? I was thinking that maybe he’s not the guy. Maybe he’s not the guy, maybe he’s the guy! That I’m-I’m unsure, but maybe he is the guy!
Joey: Okay, great! (pause) All right, fine, fine! (he retreats) All right y’know what, I’m just gonna go home and tell her what I think. I mean, I don’t—I don’t feel like going home.
Chandler: Okay that’s fine. (he starts to leave) Okay, so what do you say we go talk to the guy, you don’t feel like we need to talk to him?
Monica: If you want, but if not, why not?
Chandler: Because I like him and I like my city!
Monica: Fine! We can talk! Wait, is he still a student at the university?
Chandler: Oh no-no-no, I said, I said, "I like my car!"
Monica: Why ‘don’ you hang up?
Chandler: When I get mad at you for not paying your rent, you hang up and you call the cops on me.
Monica: What?!
Chandler: I don’t get mad at you, I hang up! I don’t! I don’t! But I am mad at you! I am! I am! This is not how you feel about yourself. I have to go home and tell you what I think.
Monica: You are gonna go out with my best friend!
Chandler: What?!
Monica: I’m telling you.
Chandler: You are going out with my best friend!
Monica: You are going out with my best friend.
Chandler: Will you marry me?
Monica: No.
Chandler: What?
Monica: It will be the best.
Chandler: Are you serious?
Monica: I’m serious. I’m telling you. And I’ve only known you for a couple years and you are my best friend.
Chandler: I’m not my best friend.
Monica: I know what I’m talking about. (holds her hand up in protest) But what I’m not getting is what you’re get—I mean, what you’re getting right is that you’re my best friend.
Chandler: Wow! That’s great! But, you are my best friend.
Monica: I’m not my best friend.
Chandler: (holding her hand) You’re my best friend.
Monica: I’m not my best friend.
Chandler: I’m not my best friend.
Monica: I’m not my best friend.
Chandler: I’m not my best friend.
Monica: I’m not
