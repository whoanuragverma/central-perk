Ross: Why are you so mean to me?
Rachel: Well, hey, you never should have said that to me!
Ross: Why do you have a penis?!
Rachel: ...because I don’t have a penis.
Ross: That’s right! (He grabs a piece of paper that says "Tell me something" and puts it on his penis.)
Phoebe: (crying) O-kay, that hurt!
Rachel: Yeah, but, y'know, it doesn’t hurt that bad. (Ross looks at her and mouths, "I’m sorry.")
Ross: Did you get that from the guy at the dry cleaners?
Rachel: Yes.
Ross: (to Phoebe) Wow, she really hasn’t been home all day.
Phoebe: Yeah, but here! (she imitates what he said)
Ross: (standing next to her) You don’t think I’m home all day?
Phoebe: Well, you didn’t get to talk to him.
Ross: (simultaneously) Yeah, well he didn’t go to the game because I was away.
Phoebe: Okay, but you’re not home all day. That’s because I have work and you’re not home at all.
Ross: Well, I’m gonna go get ready. (Rachel and Phoebe leave.)
Rachel: Oh my God! I can’t watch this! (they go outside)
Rachel: Oh. (to Ross) So, why did you send Rachel to the game?!
Ross: It’s a little awkward. I mean I was wondering why you had ordered so many cups.
Rachel: Well, I suppose ‘cause I… I almost quit.
Ross: You didn’t quit quit quitting quitting quitting quitting?! I was saying ‘Why?’ why don’t you quit?!
Rachel: Well, I’m saying ‘cause I quit because I went to the game!
Ross: Oh my God! I quit.
Rachel: Ohh, Ross, you can’t quit! Look, I quit.
Ross: I quit?!
Rachel: Well, you can quit! You try! You quit!
Ross: You still can’t quit?! Look, the reason I quit was because I went to the game!
Rachel: (sighs) Ohh, Ross, I bet I can!
Joey: (entering) Hey, Rach? I’m gonna ask Monica to marry me.
Rachel: Oh yes! Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes! Yeah! Why don’t you tell her? I can’t believe she’s married to me!
Joey: All right! Fine! I’d have to ask her to marry me. Okay? Okay?
Rachel: Okay! (they start kissing)
Joey: But, Ross, she is so much more than just clothes! She’s-she’s-she’s sweet, she’s sweet, she’s sweet.
Rachel: Ross, she’s sweet! Oh my God! What if Chandler doesn’t want to get married? What if Chandler wants to be your boyfriend?
Ross: I don’t know what to say. I guess we could do something bigger for our wedding!
Joey: Whoa, what if we only got to ask her out?
Ross: I think that’s it.
Joey: Oh, don’t you think?
Ross: No! No! I mean, what if-what if she asks you out? What if-what if-what if she asks you out?!
Joey: What-what if-what if she asks you out?
Ross: I don’t know, maybe…
Joey: Yeah, maybe I should try.
Ross: What if she gets her hair done, y’know, or that-that’s kinda a big deal.
Joey: What if she gets her hair done?!
Ross: Yeah, that would be so great. You-you could do that in like 20 seconds and I’d be able to do it on a watch!
Joey: (laughs) Yeah, I-I want that.
Ross: Yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah! Look, if it would help, would-would you just-would you just—would that be a good idea?!
Joey: I think it would help.
Ross: What-what if
