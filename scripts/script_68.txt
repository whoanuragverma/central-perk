Chandler: Hi!
Monica: Chandler, it’s me.
Chandler: What?
Monica: (To Chandler) So, how’s your date with Phoebe?
Chandler: (To Monica) Oh-ho-ho-ho-look, she’s great! (To Monica) But…
Monica: What?!
Chandler: (To Monica) She’s with someone who’s 30.
Monica: Oh my God!
Chandler: (To Monica) She was with Ross!
Monica: She’s with someone who’s overweight? I can’t believe she’s with someone who’s overweight!
Chandler: She is?
Monica: She’s with Phoebe.
Chandler: You’re so sweet to have fat friends on your birthday! (To Monica) And-and look at you with someone who’s fat.
Monica: (getting over it) Okay, I can’t believe I said that.
Chandler: Oh-ho-ho-ho-he’s so weird.
Monica: I know, but it’s just it makes you look so silly.
Chandler: Y’know, it’s just not worth this.
Monica: Yeah, but it’s worth this just the fact that you’re fat.
Chandler: No. No I’m not. I’m not. I’m not. I’m not.
Monica: This is so hard.
Chandler: Really?
Monica: I know.
Chandler: No? (Thinking) You’re right.
Monica: I am not—I’m not. I’m not. I’m not! I mean, we-we have this other woman, and now she’s not fat, she’s-she’s-she’s fat.
Chandler: Why wouldn’t you want to be fat?
Monica: I’m not fat. I mean, I’m fat.
Chandler: (Thinking) It’s like the moment you were conceived.
Monica: There’s no such thing as a "moment." It’s just a beautiful thing. (She turns to Rachel and Joey.) I wonder how this can happen?
Rachel: Hey! Hey, come on! I got one of those! (Phoebe glares at her.) What is that?
Phoebe: (Screams) Ursula! Ursula! Ursula! Ursula! Ursula!
Rachel: I don’t have that!
Phoebe: Come on! Ursula! Ursula! Ursula!
Rachel: Wh—Phoebe!
Phoebe: Okay, I’ll see you later! (Exits.)
Rachel: Okay, I guess I’m free to visit the guy I like. (Phoebe exits.)
Phoebe: Bye. (Phoebe leaves.)
Frank: (To Rachel) So you?! Cry! I do not want to see you cry!
Rachel: Yeah, I know. Look, I don’t think I’m gonna cry. Okay, I’m moving on. Yeah, you’ve been crazy but, once I see you I know I’m moving on. Y’know what? I’m doing a really good job at keeping my emotions away from my body. (Rachel doesn’t seem happy.)
Phoebe: All right, well I’m sorry, it’s just that I’m old.
Rachel: Fine! (Exchanges rings.) Oh, by the way, you’re not on your mid-term date, because I don’t want you to sleep with Chandler.
Phoebe: Oh, I know. We should talk about that. (Reaches inside her apartment and finds that Joey’s up and comforts her.) Oh, hi Rachel!
Rachel: (To Phoebe) You’re awake!
Joey: All right listen, I’m going to bed.
Rachel: Oh right, right, great! (To Phoebe) It’s just gonna be my last night here! (Exits.)
Phoebe: Wow! This place is amazing! This is the most beautiful hotel in the
