Joey: Noo!!   But hey, at least you got to know us!
Chandler: (To Monica) And the best part was when Rosalind and I were having sex on the terrace, and she said to me, (with a smirk) ‘Kay, I did it!!’
Monica: When’s the next one?
Chandler: Ooh! 2 o’clock!
Monica: That’s quite a spread! I mean it’s nice!
Chandler: Wait a minute! Are you sure you don’t want to be embarrassed telling people what you did?
Monica: No! I’m just saying no.
Chandler: Well then, it turns out that I’m actually pretty good at hiding stuff from people!
Monica: Yeah, you’re right. I’m gonna go hide.
Chandler: Okay, so that’s it? I’m gonna go for it. (He walks away.)
Chandler: Okay, so that means that you’re hiding from people?
Monica: Yeah, I’m not gonna do that either.
Chandler: Okay. (Gets up and starts to leave.)
Monica: (To Phoebe) Hey! Sorry!
Phoebe: Hey!
Monica: (To Joey) What’s going on?
Joey: Phoebe, that was the guy you said you were gonna marry!
Phoebe: Oh my God, I know!
Monica: What’s going on?
Joey: You wanted me to marry you too.
Monica: What?!
Joey: I’m sorry, I’m sorry! I mean, I was hoping that maybe that would scare them off but they’re so scared off! I mean, how can you be so stupid?!
Monica: Yeah, I guess you’re right. (Joey and Phoebe look at each other.) Is that why I keep on marrying you? Because I keep on marrying you!
Joey: Oh yeah, from now on, no matter what happens with Emma, I'm just gonna marry you. Yeah, I’m gonna marry you!
Monica: Okay. And when?! (Sits on the edge of Rachel’s bed.) Oh my God! (She then bangs on the door, knocking again.)
Rachel: (on the couch) You’re not falling asleep are you?
Joey: Yeah, yeah, I think I did. (Pause.) Yeah, it’s just I don’t know how to tell you this. But it just felt so right. I mean, I know you’re thinking, I know you’re thinking about Rachel right now, but why would you do this to her?
Rachel: Because?
Joey: Because she’s…
Rachel: (interrupts him) You don’t think I’m gonna marry her?
Joey: I don’t think you’re.
Rachel: What?
Joey: Because I’m marrying her.
Rachel: Phoebe?
Phoebe: Oh my God. Joey!
Joey: Why?
Rachel: Well, look what I found in the fridge! (Makes an unintelligible sound to reassure him.) Oh my God! We’re gonna do a kiss!
Joey: Oh that’s great!
Rachel: So what are you gonna do?
Joey: I don’t know! I mean, I-I-I don’t know! I mean, what am I gonna do? I mean, what am I gonna do to Rachel?
Rachel: Well…
Joey: You-you-you’re gonna realize how stupid this is. You just—you’re so cool and classy.
Rachel: That’s not cool and classy. I mean classy, you’re cool and classy. (Joey nods in agreement.)
Joey: Okay, maybe cool and classy is what you’re after.
Rachel: I guess so.
Joey: Right. (She nods ‘no’.)
Rachel: ‘No. ‘No.’ I’m cool and classy and—I’m cool and classy. (Exits.)

Phoebe: Hey, what’s going on?!
Ross: (To
