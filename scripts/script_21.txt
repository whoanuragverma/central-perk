Chandler: Oh, I'm still not used to having the same guy over and over again.
Ross: I know which one I have, I'm just not used to it. It's not like, y'know, you just go up to him and tell him, "Hey, how you doin?" It's like, it's like y'know, kiss him, and then if he doesn't like it, he leaves.
Chandler: Hey, I've never kissed you this way before.
Ross: Well, it's like, I'm in a play right now, and it's so brutal! I could just kiss you right now.
Chandler: Hey, you're not supposed to do that.
Ross: Huh, come on, give me that.
Chandler: What?
Ross: I'm gonna go kiss you right now, but first, I have to ask you something.
Chandler: Really?
Ross: Yeah.
Chandler: Okay, I want you to kiss me right now, but first kiss me.
Ross: Okay, I'm gonna start kissing again.
Chandler: Okay.
Ross: Okay.
Chandler: Okay.
Ross: Wait, don't, don't do it.
Chandler: I'm so nervous, I can't do it.
Chandler: Oh, I'm gonna stop right there, but I'm going to ask you again.
Ross: Okay, I'm gonna stop, but I'm going to ask you again.
Chandler: So you do this every time!
Ross: That's why I'm having this problem with Joey, because I'm so familiar with his charm!
Chandler: Well, then, it's like, what is the problem?
Ross: I don't know. I've only heard it from other guys, but it's always been there, it's like Joey's charm, 'cause he reads all the magazines to him, and he wears four belts, so he just keeps giving Joey's looks, and I just think he's trying to make it up to him.
Chandler: So you're not just losing Joey's charm, you're trying to put it back?
Ross: No, no, no, no, no, no. This guy is like the Chan-Chan of magazines, with her fine chamois and lace under her robe, and her toes just barely curling up like lace!
Chandler: Then, she is the Chan-Chand of chamoung!
Ross: And there's even more reason for that, than just numbers! (To Chandler) She's the Chan-Chand of chamoung!
Chandler: There's even more reason for that, than just numbers!
Ross: There's even more reason for that, than just numbers!
Chandler: There's even more reason for that, than just numbers!
Ross: There's even more reason for that, than just numbers!
