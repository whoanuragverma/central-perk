Chandler: Oh, by the way, do you really want to go shopping tonight?
Chandler: Oh, umm how about tonight?
Chandler: Um, yeah, tonight we were shopping and I had this great beer by the way, so uh, we went to have drinks.
Phoebe: Oh, is this great beer by the way?
Chandler: Absolutely! Can you believe I almost got fired earlier?
Phoebe: (to Monica) Would you guys want some beer?
Monica: More beers?
Chandler: Yeah! Ross, I talked to him, he said he wants to spend the night, so we should have some fun.
Phoebe: Oh, you guys wanna have some fun?
Monica: Sure! We should all go out that night and get some drinks!
Chandler: Okay, fine! You guys should all go out to have drinks tonight! We should all go out to have a good time! (They all go over to the door and close it, Chandler and Monica hug each other.)
Ross: Hey Pheebs, listen, I know you guys really need me right now, so I better get moving or I'm just gonna freak out.
Phoebe: You guys should all go out to have drinks tonight. We should all go out to have a good time.

Monica: So uh, whaddya think we are?
Chandler: I think we're just gonna have some beers.
Monica: Oh, okay. (Goes to have a glass of wine.)
Phoebe: So what do we do?
Monica: We're just gonna hang out.
Chandler: Oh yeah, that makes sense. But what if they just hire me?
Monica: What do you mean that I'm my own company?
Chandler: Well, I mean, that's what I was talking about. Look, but if you're talking about me they need me for, you know, the new head of the department.
Rachel: (getting up from the couch) Phoebe, you know what guys? If you want some help, I don't think you should come at me like that.
Phoebe: Why?
Rachel: Because you're creepy and please, I want to sleep with you and kiss you and I want that.
Phoebe: I don't know if that's true.
Rachel: All right fine, I do. But y'know what, if you want me, I don't have to sleep with you.
Phoebe: Except I don't.
